# Andromeda Core Cryptography Library

This repository contains the `corecrypto` kernel-mode cryptography
library, as used in Andromeda. It also contains `libcorecrypto`,
the user-mode equivalent thereof.

**This repository is deprecated**, and will not be used in
any version of Andromeda. The crypto functions that it does
contain have been ported to reside inside the kernel itself.
